# 🔹 Cursor Frontend Development Rules

## 1️⃣ General Guidelines
- ✅ All frontend work should be done inside `frontend/feature/{task-name}`.
- ✅ **Cursor is responsible for merging the final approved code into `main`.**
- ✅ All frontend components must be fully tested before merging.

## 2️⃣ Git Branching & Deployment Strategy
- 📌 **Step 1:** Create a new branch for every feature  
  `git checkout -b feature/frontend-{task-name}`
- 📌 **Step 2:** Commit changes inside `frontend/feature/{task-name}`  
- 📌 **Step 3:** Run frontend tests in `frontend/tests/`
- 📌 **Step 4:** If tests pass, push the branch and create a **Pull Request to `dev` branch**  
  `git push origin feature/frontend-{task-name}`
- 📌 **Step 5:** **Cursor will review the backend (`dev`) branch and merge final code into `main`.**

## 3️⃣ Who Pushes to `main`?
- ❌ **Cursor DOES NOT push directly to `main`.**
- ✅ **Cursor merges `backend/dev` into `main` ONLY when:**
  - Backend APIs are tested and functional.
  - UI components are fully tested.
  - The full feature has been approved.
